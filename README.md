## Hi, I'm Gustavo ðŸ¤ª
I develop web and mobile apps thinking about the best user experience. I have already worked on projects with institutions such as SAP, Bayer, MinistÃ©rio PÃºblico do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo and EY. I believe that with technology and innovation we can improve a better society, solve big problems and challenges today.
